    "# The Path to Empirical Orthogonal Function Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we're going to continue to set the stage to use empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis (or principal components analysis, PCA) on our spatiotemporal data.  We'll learn about these in the next lecture and they will be our new friend -- in one form or another -- through the rest of the class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the we anticipate that our data will be linearly dependent - that some of our time series can be expressed as linear combinations of others.  This means they will covary, they will be correlated, and they will not be orthogonal (they will have a non-zero dot product when the time series of our data and multiplied with one another).  As we've said, this both provides challenges (mathematically and statistically) but also potentially reveals something about the larger-scale and perhaps causal nature of our data.  EOF analysis and the related techniques we will learn (and still others that we don't have time for) will allow us to both handle the challenge and leverage the advantages of our data. \n",
