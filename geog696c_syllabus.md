# Spatiotemporal Data Analysis  

</div>

This course is designed as a graduate level class in a *workshop* format to give students a theoretical framework, practical experience, expert knowledge, and statistical tools for analyzing spatiotemporal datasets. Topics include basic matrix algebra and statistics, exploratory data analysis, field correlation and regression analysis, autocorrelation and its statistical consequences in time and space, parametric and non-parametric significance testing and error analysis, empirical orthogonal functions including rotation, singular spectrum analysis, maximum covariance and canonical correspondence analysis, and traditional and multitaper spectral analysis. The course encompasses instruction and training in Python and in the use and manipulation of large multi-dimensional datasets. The major outcome for the class for each student will be a new and independent analysis of a substantial space-time dataset, a formal manuscript describing the motivation, methods, and results of this analysis, and a professional oral presentation. Students are encouraged to bring with them or seek out data relevant to their research to use for their final project. Ideally, students’ final projects will provide the material for a thesis chapter and/or peer-reviewed article.

## Course Information  

**Prerequisites**  
Continuing graduate student status in a degree program at the University of Arizona or permission from instructor. Some prior mathematics or statistical courses are encouraged. Prior programming experience encouraged but not required.


**Course Objectives**  
This course has the following objectives:  

-   Factual: You will acquire fundamental knowledge of mathematical and
    statistical methods for the analysis of space-time data, including
    the basics of linear algebra and matrix operations. You will become
    familiar with the terminology used to described space-time data and
    the statistical procedures and outcomes applied in spatiotemporal
    data analysis. You will be able to locate and acquire appropriate
    data.

-   Conceptual: You will develop an understanding of the available
    spatiotemporal statistical tools and when to best or appropriately
    apply them to exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and
    data reduction and regularization. You will cultivate a first-order
    understanding of the motivations, advantages, and disadvantages for
    different procedures and how uncertainties in the underlying data
    and methods potentially propagate through your analyses. You will be
    able to identify sources of both signal and noise in your data and
    analyses.

-   Procedural: You will learn how to apply specific methodologies to
    the analysis of spatiotemporal data, including the practical,
    hands-on procedures for managing data and implementing these methods
    and approaches in a high level programming language (Python). You
    will be able to differentiate between the relative magnitudes and
    significance of effects or processes and recognize and remove errors
    associated with data or the implementation of your procedures
    (‘debugging’).

-   Metacognitive: You will recognize the potential and limitation of
    statistical and data analytical methods with respect to the
    constraints from the underlying physical, deterministic processes
    you seek to explore. You will be able to identify reasonable (and
    unreasonable) inferences or conclusions from your analyses. You will
    develop an enhanced recognition of how potential biases – including
    both methodological as well as cognitive – enter into statistical
    analyses of both deterministic and stochastic systems and inference
    based on these results. You will practice deploying both
    quantitative analyses and qualitative reasoning using your
    methodological skills and systems-based knowledge. You will
    recognize how the mathematical basis of the methods used may limit
    the utility of these for some data types or dynamic systems.

**Learning Outcomes**

<div class="adjustwidth">

By the end of the semester, students will be able to design and conduct a complete statistical analysis of a spatiotemporal dataset. The students will be able to build and test their own analytical programs using a high-level computer language and apply their code to the quantitative analysis of a dataset relevant to their own research. Students will be able to make abductive inferences about the physical or social system they are studying by applying their analysis and their understanding of the magnitude and sources of uncertainty. Students will be able to describe, support, and defend their inferences in a public presentation to the class.

**Required Texts or Readings**  
There is no required textbook for this course. Required readings will be posted on D2L.

**Precedent and Acknowledgement**  
This course and its structure and content was inspired and influenced by spatiotemporal data and objective analysis classes taught by Mike Evans (University of Maryland) and John Chiang (Berkeley).
 

**Assignments and Methods of Assessment**

<div class="description">

Prework: \[20%\] These assignments will consist of readings and guided
responses and will provide the theoretical or practical motivation or
background for topics studied in this class. The assignments (including
necessary readings) will be available a week or more prior to their due
date, which will be indicated on the Course Schedule. These are
individual assignments and students must prepare and submit to D2L an
individual (non-collaborative) document. These assignments will be
graded by the instructor. A rubric will be provided with each
assignment.

Homework: \[20%\] These assignments will include mathematical,
statistical, and programming problems intended to provide practical and
hands-on learning in Python, and to prepare students to conduct their
own analyses of their own chosen dataset. Assignments will be posted one
week (or more) before they are due. In most cases classroom workshop
time will be available for students to query the instructor. These are
individual assignments and students must prepare and submit to D2L an
individual (non-collaborative) document, although students are
encouraged to discuss programming challenges they encounter. These
assignments will be *self-graded* using the D2L online quiz system and a
suggested solution set provided by the instructor.

Final Project (Paper): \[50%\] This assignment will be a manuscript,
appropriately formatted for a significant peer-reviewed journal in the
student’s field of interest. Specific length and content (figures and
tables) depend both on the analysis, the data, the hypothesis and
research question, and the standard of the target journal and scientific
field, but should reflect a substantial body of work, reflect the
standards of the field and journal, be free of errors, and be of
appropriate quality and significance that the manuscript could
reasonably be finalized for actual submission. This is an individual
assignment and students must prepare and submit to D2L an individual
(non-collaborative) manuscript. This assignment will be graded by the
instructor. A rubric will be provided no later than Friday, November
19th. The assignment is **due on D2L no later than Wednesday, December
13th at 5:00pm Arizona time**. Students planning to attend AGU that week
are encouraged to turn their assignment in early.

Final Project (Presentation): \[10%\] This assignment is a 15 minute (12
minute talk, 3 minutes for questions) professional talk describing the
motivations and findings of the students’ paper and manuscript. The
presentation schedule will be determined and a rubric made available no
later than Friday, November 17th. Students are expected to prepare and
give a talk reflecting the standards and practices of their field and to
run within the given time window (15 minutes). This is an individual
assignment. This assignment will be graded by the instructor with input
from the student’s peers. ***Attendance is required for all students for
the student presentation days (November 28th, November 30th, and
December 5th)***.
